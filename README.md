# What is this

Someone asked following in Symfony Slack;

```
xxxxxx 19:35
Guys, my VarDumper is appearing above my HTML instead of inside the dump 
icon on debug's bar. Am I doing something wrong?
```

Within this repository I'm showing how to make that working as expected.

## Demo

1) Clone this repository
2) Run `composer install`
3) Run `symfony server:start`
4) Open your favorite browser with `http://localhost:8000` url - just check the correct url from previous command

You should see demo page with debug toolbar where you can see `debug` 
of current response.

## How?

Just see the commit history of this repository each step is on separated commit.
